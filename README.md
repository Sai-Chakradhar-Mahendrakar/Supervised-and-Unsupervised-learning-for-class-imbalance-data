# Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Approaches on Class Imbalanced Data

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Approaches on Class Imbalanced Data**, was submitted to SRM University AP, Andhra Pradesh, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Machine Learning Course (CSE 336L) as part of the Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering program.

## Abstract

Class imbalance is a significant issue in machine learning that affects the performance of algorithms. This project addresses this problem by combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on an imbalanced dataset. The study involves conducting sensitivity analysis, applying decision tree algorithms for predictive modeling, and using cluster analysis to reduce dimensionality and enhance interpretability. The results demonstrate that a hybrid approach involving decision tree, SVM, KNN, and cluster analysis is effective for handling imbalanced data.

## Introduction

### Significance of Class Imbalance

Class imbalance is a common issue in many real-world applications, leading to biased model predictions favoring the majority class. This project proposes a novel methodology combining supervised and unsupervised techniques to address class imbalance.

### Motivation

Addressing class imbalance is crucial for improving the effectiveness and reliability of machine learning models in applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection.

## Literature Survey

### Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. Common algorithms include classifiers and regressors. The training phase involves showing the computer labeled examples, while the testing phase evaluates its performance on new data.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning explores data without predefined labels, discovering patterns and structures. Primary tasks include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (simplifying data while retaining its essence).

## Design and Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

We selected an imbalanced dataset from a publicly available repository. Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

### Sensitivity Analysis

Conducted to identify the most influential variables for predictive modeling.

### Supervised Predictive Modeling
